# Operational Metrics & KPI Governance Engine  
### End-to-End BI Engineering Project (SQL + Python + Dashboard + KPI Framework)

This project demonstrates how to design, validate, and automate operational KPIs such as SLA, AHT, backlog, and ticket lifecycle metrics using structured data, SQL logic, Python validation scripts, and executive-ready dashboards.

It simulates a real-world analytics workflow used in large-scale support operations (Amazon-style), including data modeling, KPI governance, anomaly detection, and metric reliability checks.
